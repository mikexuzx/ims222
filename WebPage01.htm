Hey! My name is Zhengxiang Xu, and you can called me Mike as well which is my English name. I'm major in ETBD Digital Concentration major. I love Apple, Disney+Pixar, Nintendo and so much more creative companies. That's why I've chosen to learn more about design for my future dream jobs. By the way, I enjoy taking photographs when I go outside. It could give me lots of inspirations in different ways.
