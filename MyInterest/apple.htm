<h1><b>Why Apple</b></h1>
<p>
When I got my first Apple device which was the iPod touch 4th generation, it makes me keep following and researching the Apple's legendary stories. The first photo below was taken last year at Apple Store Wangfujing in Beijing. I was amazed that Apple's Tim Cook came to the store and joined the special event for ten minutes. I love Today at Apple series which is including different kinds of free workshops about Apple product. The second picture is my Apple Watch Pride Bands collection. It shows my proud spirits of supporting Apple and LGBT(Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) community.
