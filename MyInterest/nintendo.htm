<h1><b>Why Nintendo</b></h1>
<p>
As you notice, the headline of the Nintendo does not mean the actual Nintendo classic console. In my opinion, it means the real entertainment that Nintendo would like to share with us. My first interaction of Nintendo games was on April 1, 2020. It was also the day that I got my very first game console which is Nintendo Switch. A few years ago, I had no idea about the concepts of the gaming systems until the pandemic began. The most significant thing that made me fall in love with Nintendo is Animal Crossing: New Horizons where the game provide people a whole new experience of social networking. Of course, the most famous game series in the world may be the Super Mario Bros series. The first photo below was my game collection of Super Mario Bros series in 2020. The second one was my selfie as Animal Crossing villager at Christmas.
